  <h1>The Toronto Streets Guessing Game!</h1>
  <h2>I've had this idea for a while now, but I finally thought the time had come to test it out. A few guidelines:</h2>
  <h3>In most cases, you'll only need the street name, not the type (e.g. road). Case-insensitive, but no punctuation unless it's Irish! Highways and streets with no obvious type are the exception. (The hoverable names will be a little funky for those ones.)</h3>
  <h3>A note about the type "Way": a bunch of private streets in North York are labeled "Way" with a prefix. I've split the prefixes for these (except Carseway, Shepway, and Starway), so you have to guess the street name and prefix together!</h3>
  <h3>Oh, one last thing: all numbered streets are written with letters and no hyphens, because that's how the City does it. Have fun!</h3>
